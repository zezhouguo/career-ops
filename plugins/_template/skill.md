# {{NAME}}

## How to run it

- `node plugins.mjs run {{NAME}}` — runs the plugin's hook.

## What it produces

TODO: describe the data structure. For a producer hook, the `Job[]` fields you
emit (title, url, company, location). For an export hook, what you push and where.

## Settings

TODO: any non-secret options the user sets in `config/plugins.yml` under
`plugins.{{NAME}}` (these arrive as `ctx.settings`).
