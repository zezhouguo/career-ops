# Running Career-Ops on a Budget

Token usage costs and rate limits are the most common bottlenecks when setting up a high-volume job search pipeline. Since Career-Ops processes full job descriptions, evaluates them against your CV across 10 dimensions, and tailors resumes/cover letters, the context size can grow quickly.

Fortunately, **Career-Ops is completely AI-agnostic.** The pipeline relies on the AI coding CLI (or standalone scripts) to process prompt files under `modes/`. This means you can point your CLI to cheaper API providers or local models with **zero code changes** in Career-Ops.

## 1. The Core Concept: Model Agnosticism

Career-Ops is composed of local templates, Markdown prompts, and Node/Playwright scripts. The AI logic is driven entirely by whichever AI coding CLI you run it in (e.g., Claude Code, OpenCode, Qwen CLI, Codex, Antigravity CLI, or Grok Build CLI).

By choosing a CLI that supports custom model configurations and routing it to a cheaper API provider or local LLM, you can drastically reduce your pipeline running costs without losing any functionality.

## 2. Configuring Alternative CLI Setups

Different CLIs offer different levels of flexibility for model routing. The two most common options for budget setups are **OpenCode** and **Qwen CLI**.

### OpenCode CLI
OpenCode is an open-source coding agent that easily routes to custom API providers (like DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Together AI) or local endpoints (Ollama).

To configure OpenCode with a custom provider:
1. Initialize/open OpenCode in the project directory:
   ```bash
   opencode
   ```
2. Open its configuration settings (usually located in `.opencode/config.json` or configured via CLI prompts/settings).
3. Set the `provider` to your chosen endpoint (e.g., OpenRouter or a custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint).
4. Configure the environment variables for custom endpoints if needed:
   ```bash
   # For Git Bash / Linux / macOS:
   export OPENAI_API_BASE="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openrouter_api_key_here"

   # For Windows CMD:
   set OPENAI_API_BASE=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
   set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here

   # For Windows PowerShell:
   $env:OPENAI_API_BASE="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
   $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openrouter_api_key_here"
   ```

### Qwen CLI
Qwen CLI natively supports Qwen models but can be configured to point to any custom OpenAI-compatible API base URL:
```bash
# For Git Bash / Linux / macOS:
export QWEN_API_BASE="https://api.deepseek.com/v1"
export QWEN_API_KEY="your_deepseek_api_key_here"

# For Windows CMD:
set QWEN_API_BASE=https://api.deepseek.com/v1
set QWEN_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key_here

# For Windows PowerShell:
$env:QWEN_API_BASE="https://api.deepseek.com/v1"
$env:QWEN_API_KEY="your_deepseek_api_key_here"
```

## 3. Recommended Cost-Efficient Models

When choosing a budget-friendly model, you need strong reasoning capabilities to handle the multi-dimensional scoring and resume tailoring. Here are the recommended models that hold up well under evaluation:

| Model | Provider / Endpoint | Price per 1M Input / Output Tokens | Why use it |
|-------|---------------------|------------------------------------|------------|
| **DeepSeek V3** | DeepSeek API / OpenRouter | ~$0.14 / ~$0.28 | **Top Recommendation.** Unmatched reasoning-to-price ratio; performs close to frontier models at a fraction of the cost. |
| **DeepSeek-Coder-V2** | DeepSeek API / OpenRouter | ~$0.14 / ~$0.28 | Excellent instruction-following for structured Markdown and resume tailoring. |
| **Qwen-2.5-Coder (32B / 72B)** | OpenRouter / DeepInfra | ~$0.07 - ~$0.30 | Strong coding and structured reasoning, highly cost-effective. |
| **GLM-4-Air / GLM-4** | Zhipu AI / OpenRouter | Very Cheap | Reliable multi-turn reasoning and JSON/Markdown generation. |
| **Gemini 2.5 Flash** | Google AI Studio | Free Tier (15 RPM) | Available via the standalone script `node gemini-eval.mjs`. Excellent for zero-cost low-volume runs, but subject to rate limits. |

> **Standalone evaluator (no CLI config needed):** every OpenAI-compatible provider above (DeepSeek, Qwen, GLM, Together, Groq, OpenRouter, …) works directly through `node openai-eval.mjs` — just set a base URL, model, and key:
> ```bash
> OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1 \
> OPENAI_MODEL=deepseek/deepseek-chat \
> OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key \
> node openai-eval.mjs --file ./jds/job.txt
> ```
> Run `node openai-eval.mjs --help` for per-provider examples. For 100% local/private use, point `--url` at a local server (LM Studio / llama.cpp / vLLM) or use `node ollama-eval.mjs`.

## 4. Local LLM Tradeoffs (Ollama / Llama.cpp)

Running a model 100% locally via Ollama is completely free, but it comes with significant tradeoffs:

### The Size vs. Quality Tradeoff
- **Avoid Small Models (e.g., 8B parameters)**: Models like Llama 3 8B or Qwen-2.5-Coder 7B are generally **too weak** for Career-Ops. They frequently fail to follow the complex evaluation schemas (A-G blocks), fail to output valid Markdown/JSON structures, or generate low-quality, generic resume customizations.
- **Minimum Recommended Size**: Use at least a **32B+ or 70B+ model** (such as Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B/72B or Llama 3.1 70B) for reliable scoring and high-quality resume tailoring.

### Hardware & VRAM Requirements
Running 32B or 70B models locally requires substantial system resources:
- A **32B model** requires a GPU with at least **16GB - 24GB VRAM** (e.g., RTX 3090/4090, Mac Studio, or Apple Silicon Mac with 32GB+ unified memory).
- A **70B model** requires at least **48GB VRAM** to run at decent speeds.

> 💡 **Budget Tip**: For most users, running **DeepSeek V3** or **Qwen 2.5 Coder 72B** via a cheap hosted API (like DeepSeek directly or OpenRouter) is far more efficient and cost-effective than investing in local hardware, costing only a few cents for dozens of evaluations.

## 5. Token-Saving Best Practices

To prevent unnecessary API costs or hitting rate limits, implement the following practices:

1. **Use the Batch Limit Flag**:
   Instead of manually splitting `batch/batch-input.tsv`, use the `--limit <N>` flag to process only a small capped number of offers (e.g. 5-10) in a single run. This lets you inspect the output quality before committing to a larger run:
   ```bash
   ./batch/batch-runner.sh --limit 5
   ```
2. **Use the Dry Run Flag**:
   Always run a dry run first to verify which offers will be processed:
   ```bash
   ./batch/batch-runner.sh --dry-run
   ```
3. **Resume Interrupted Runs**:
   If a batch run is interrupted by a rate limit or network error, do not restart from scratch. Use the `--resume-paused` flag to continue from where it left off, skipping completed jobs and preventing wasted tokens:
   ```bash
   ./batch/batch-runner.sh --resume-paused
   ```
4. **Use `--verify` on Scans**:
   When running job board scans, use the liveness verifier to filter out expired postings before they enter your pipeline. This prevents wasting LLM tokens evaluating closed jobs:
   ```bash
   npm run scan -- --verify
   ```
